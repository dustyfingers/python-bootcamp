# traditional python function declaration
def square(num):
    return num * num


# equivalent to an anonymous function in javascript!
# you wont usually use it like this though... (assigned to a variable)
# squareLambda = lambda num: num * num
# print(squareLambda(4))

# usually you use them to pass into other functions as anonymous functions

print(square(4))


# using lambdas!
# see map.py!
